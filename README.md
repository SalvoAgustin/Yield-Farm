# Yield-Farm
Multi-proposit yield farming contracts

If you wanna implement it, you need to pass BEP20 - ERC20 address token at constructor, having the .sol of that of course
You need to pass the ownership of the token contract to the master too.
Actually of you want to have timelocked changes at master contract simply pass the ownership to timelock after deployment.
